# Moonbeam Polkadot Substrate Proposal Fair web: DAO Governance

**By**: Livetree.com

We will open source all relevant governance contracts and try to help the Moonbeam community by making our work dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses and available through this public repo.

## Project Description

As part of creating a fair web we will utilise Moonbeam as initially a bridge to the Polkdot/Substrate eco-system from our existing Ethereum code base The bridge provides access to Polkadot functionality which we will use a) for the governance of the seed token b) for the governance of crowdfunds and c) governance of big data related to recommendation engines.  In the first instance, seed token governance will be community driven around the value inputs and outputs, namely, how input fees from the platform are exchanged and outputs being to a decentralised exchange (provisionally as uniswap) and in the second instance the video based crowdfunds related to raising money to help combat the climate and bio-diversity crisis’ we as humanity face today.  The funds will be raised via thought-leader/influencer/branded sustainability focused short form videos, documentaries and long-form films which will use our existing video streaming infrastructure. We have been working for 3 years building our network of content providers and thought leaders and currently have a potential reach of over 4m sustainability focused community memebers. Lastly, the governance of big-data primarily focused on the video meta-data (currently being migrated to Filecoin/IPFS) to facilitate decentralising our systems for royalty payments, programmatic ads and recommendation engines. Our goal is to decentralise how our data is used online and help fulfil the vision of web 3.0. We anticipate wide adoption as we already have a fairly significant footprint (and as mentioned have a network of content providers that have a potential reach of 4 million people) in addition to the fact that there is currently no simple way to capture and ingest live video, video and related web meta-data to effectively enable decentralised marketplaces and machine learning tools.

## Value

Fair web is valuable for Moonbeam because it aligns values in storytelling to Web 3.0. Please read more about the project here: www.livetree.com

We also envisage that by utilising Moonbeam we will be able to engage with a number of projects within the Polkadot ecosystem and furthermore develop our own substrate functionality where needed.

## Project key benefits

We have already invested significantly into the technology of OTT video streaming, crowdfunding and video machine learning while having developed a sizeable network of leading content providers (BBC, Channel 4 + 30+ others)  we  believe Polkadot offers the ability to finally realise our ambitions to decentralise the governance of the crowdfunds and also the royalties associated with the data harvested from content views. We set about developing this vision on Ethereum and with the advent of Polkadot now feel it is possible to realise this in a cost effective method (i.e. without the restrictive gas fees).  Our values serve as the foundation for the next Livetree infrastructure which will use Moonbeam as a bridge to substrate. In its current implementation it is a successful project when measured by the number of influencers, content providers, users and existing video capabilities. If this project is successfully implemented, this audience would contribute to the mass adoption of Moonbeam.

## Project risks

The project has relatively low risk as the fiat budget for development is being funded by Livetree, however, we ask Moonbeam to reward the project in GLMR tokens. Note we feel there is potential for the Moonbeam ecosystem to built out micro-products from each of our milestone outputs.

## Technical risks

Moonbeam has not launched its mainnet yet and we have yet to use Chainbridge in a production environment.

## Deliverables

A number of smart contracts developed in Solidity will be ported using the moon beam toolset. The bridged to Polkadot will serve as the foundation for the governance systems we plan to implement using Substrate.

There will be several elements such as web-api, user mobile applications and angular web-apps.
