# Moonbeam Proposal Fair web: DAO Governance For Crowdfunds and Big Data

**Proposer**: livetreetech

Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?: Yes

## Project Description

As part of creating a fair web we will utilise Moonbeam as initially a bridge to the Polkdot/Substrate eco-system from our existing Ethereum code base The bridge provides access to Polkadot functionality which we will use a) for the governance of crowdfunds and b) governance of big data related to recommendation engines.  In the first instance, the crowdfunds relate to raising money to help combat the climate and bio-diversity crisis’ we are humanity face today.  The funds will be raised via thought-leader/influencer/branded sustainability focused short form videos, documentaries and long-form films which will use our existing video streaming infrastructure. Furthermore, the governance of big-data primarily focused on royalty payments, programmatic ads and recommendation engines will be developed to decentralise how our data is used online and help fulfil the vision of web 3.0. We anticipate wide adoption as we already have a fairly significant footprint and have a network of content providers that have a reach of 4 million people in addition to the fact that there is currently no simple way to capture and ingest live video, video and related web meta-data to effectively enable decentralised marketplaces and machine learning tools.

## Value

Fair web is valuable for Moonbeam because it aligns values in storytelling to Web 3.0. Please read more about the project here: www.livetree.com

We also envisage that by utilising Moonbeam we will be able to engage with a number of projects within the Polkadot ecosystem and furthermore develop our own substrate functionality where needed.

## Project key benefits

We have already invested significantly into the technology of OTT video streaming, crowdfunding and video machine learning while having developed a sizeable network of leading content providers (BBC, Channel 4 + 30+ others)  we  believe Polkadot offers the ability to finally realise our ambitions to decentralise the governance of the crowdfunds and also the royalties associated with the data harvested from content views. We set about developing this vision on Ethereum and with the advent of Polkadot now feel it is possible to realise this in a cost effective method (i.e. without the restrictive gas fees).  Our values serve as the foundation for the next Livetree infrastructure which will use Moonbeam as a bridge to substrate. In its current implementation it is a successful project when measured by the number of influencers, content providers, users and existing video capabilities. If this project is successfully implemented, this audience would contribute to the mass adoption of Moonbeam.

## Project risks

Moonbeam has relatively low risk as the grant budget is being funded by Livetree, however, we ask Moonbeam to reward the project in GLMR tokens. Note we feel there is potential for the Moonbeam ecosystem to built out micro-products from each of our milestone outputs.

## Technical risks

Moonbeam has not launched its mainnet yet and we have yet to use Chainbridge in a production environment.

##Deliverables

A number of smart contracts developed in Solidity will be ported using the moon beam toolset. The bridged to Polkadot will serve as the foundation for the governance systems we plan to implement using Substrate.

There will be several elements such as web-api, user mobile applications and angular web-apps.

Cost: $3,000

Time: 4 weeks

##Livetree budget

    Milestone 1: $7,000
    Milestone 2: $25,000
    Milestone 3: $24,000
    Milestone 4: $3,000

Total: $59,000

##Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Upon project realisation, it will be open source so various communities will be able to extend and enhance it with additional features. Being open-source we anticipate a number of projects being able to leverage not only the source code but the data we populate.
